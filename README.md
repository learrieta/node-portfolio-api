# Portfolio Api

This app is built using Node.js, Express.js and Postgres. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side, while
Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js while Postgres is used to store structured data and is often used as a back-end database for web
applications. Together, they provide a powerful and efficient platform for building the backend of this portfolio app.

We use Express.js to handle routing and handle HTTP requests, and to set up an API endpoint that the frontend can use to make requests to the backend.
Node.js and Express.js also provide a range of modules and middleware that we use to handle things like parsing JSON data, handling file uploads, and
more.Postgres is used to save the data using a database that will eventually be display in the frontend. By using Node.js and Express.js and Postgres
I am able to quickly and easily build a scalable, efficient backend that can handle the demands of the porfolio app.

## Running the server

open a terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

which will allow installing the project's dependencies. Still in the terminal run:

```
nodemon
```

to run the developement server.
